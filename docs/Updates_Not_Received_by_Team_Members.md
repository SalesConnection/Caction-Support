## My updates are not received by my admin and other team members. Why?

### Here are the potential issues and solutions:

1. Poor Internet Connection:<br>

   - Check if your internet connection is stable.<br>
  &emsp;If it's unstable, try switching to a more reliable network, such as a mobile hotspot or a different Wi-Fi network.<br>

   - Test your internet speed.<br>
     1. Enter the speed test website: [https://www.speedtest.net/result/16588514558](https://www.speedtest.net/result/16588514558)
     2. Start to test the internet speed.
     3. If the speed is **below 25 Mbps**, you may experience difficulties in updating. If possible, switch to a faster internet connection.<br><br>

2. Page Not Refreshed:<br>

   - Ensure all team members, including your admin, refresh their page to receive the latest updates.<br><br>

3. Updates are stuck in pending upload:<br>

   - Go to your Pending Data in the User Profile page to see if there are any items still loading.
   - Should the list still not move even after connecting to a stronger internet connection, please contact our support team at 012-278 0122. When contacting support, please provide the following information:
     1. Your account details (Company name, username, and phone number/email registered).
     2. The date and time of when the issue occurred. If the issue still persists, inform our team on it as well.
     3. A screenshot of the error page.<br>

   *Note: Should the issue be updates being stuck on pending upload, DO NOT relog from the system as your pending update data will be lost.
