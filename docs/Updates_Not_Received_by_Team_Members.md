## My updates are not received by my admin and other team members. Why?

### Here are the potential issues and solutions:

1. Poor Internet Connnection:<br>

   - Check if your internet connection is stable.<br>
  &emsp;If it's unstable, try switching to a more reliable network, such as a mobile hotspot or a different Wi-Fi network.<br>

   - Test your internet speed.<br>
  &emsp;If the speed is below 25 Mbps, you may experience difficulties in updating. If possible, switch to a faster internet connection.<br><br>

2. Page Not Refreshed:<br>

   - Ensure all team members, including your admin, refresh their page to receive the latest updates.
