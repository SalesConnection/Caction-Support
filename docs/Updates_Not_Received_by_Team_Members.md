### Scenario below will cause the problem and how to solve it:

  1. Bad Internet Connnection.<br>

  &emsp;If the internet connection is weak, please contact to another network (e.g. colleague's mobile hotspot) and try again.<br>

     b. Is the internet speed **fast** enough?<br>
  &emsp;Search for any internet speed testing website and make sure that the internet speed is **more than 25 Mbps**.<br><br>
