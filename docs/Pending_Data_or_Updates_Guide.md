Pending data is usually used to check if a user has informed that a comment has been showing as pending for a long time in job details page. In such cases, support team will require user to take screenshot of the pending data so the team can check on it. (As shown below)

### My updates are not received by my admin and other team members. Why?<br>
### Here are the potential issues and solutions:

1. Poor Internet Connection:<br>

   - Check if your internet connection is stable.<br>
  &emsp;If it's unstable, try switching to a more reliable network, such as a mobile hotspot or a different Wi-Fi network.<br>

   - Test your internet speed.<br>
     1. Enter the speed test website: [https://www.speedtest.net/result/16588514558](https://www.speedtest.net/result/16588514558)
     2. Start to test the internet speed.
     3. If the speed is **below 25 Mbps**, you may experience difficulties in updating. If possible, switch to a faster internet connection.<br><br>

2. Page Not Refreshed:<br>

   - Ensure all team members, including your admin, refresh their page to receive the latest updates.<br><br>

3. Updates are stuck in pending upload:<br>

   - Go to your Pending Data in the User Profile page to see if there are any items still loading.
   - Should the list still not move even after connecting to a stronger internet connection, please contact our support team at 012-278 0122. When contacting support, please provide the following information:
     1. Your account details (Company name, username, and phone number/email registered).
     2. The date and time of when the issue occurred. If the issue still persists, inform our team on it as well.
     3. A screenshot of the error page.<br>

   *Note: Should the issue be updates being stuck on pending upload, DO NOT relog from the system as your pending update data will be lost.
