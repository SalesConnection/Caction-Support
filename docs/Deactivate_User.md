## Deactivate a Resigned User
### What happens when a user is deactivated?
- The user can't login to the system.<br>
- The user's data will still stay in the system (e.g. Assigned to/ Creator column, job schedule, metrics, etc.)<br>
- A deactivated user account is not counted as one.<br><br>

### How to deactivate a user?
1. On the desktop site, go to the navigation bar, select HR Suite, then click User List.<br>
   **Open User List Page Here:** [https://system.caction.com/usermanage/userlist](https://system.caction.com/usermanage/userlist)<br>
   *Note: Only certain admins can deactivate users.<br>
