## ⚠ Change to a New User
### What happens if I replace a resigned user with a new user in the system?
- The resigned user will no longer have the system access.<br>
- The new user will have all items previously assigned to or created by the resigned user.<br>
- **All historical data** of the resigned user will be **overwritten** by the new user (e.g. Assigned to/ Creator columns, job schedule, metrics, etc.)<br><br>

### How to change to a new user?
1. Go to desktop site navigation bar > HR Suite > User List.<br>
   **Open User List Page Here:** [https://system.caction.com/usermanage/userlist](https://system.caction.com/usermanage/userlist)<br>
   *Note: Only certain admins can deactivate users.<br>
