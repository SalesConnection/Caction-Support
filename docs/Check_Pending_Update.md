## How to check if my staff have any pending updates?

Check on any pending upload item(s) by each of your user. If you receive a message saying "Unable to Retrieve Results", it could mean the following reason(s):

 i. Selected user has an unstable connection and system is unable to connect to their device.<br>
 ii. Selected user did not have the app running in the background.<br>
 iii. Selected user had swiped off the app.<br><br>

1. At the desktop site's Main Navigation, go to User Management > Check Pending Update.<br>
   **Check Pending Update here**: [https://salesconnection.my/checkPendingUploads](https://salesconnection.my/checkPendingUploads)<br>

   *Note: You must have access to User Management menu to perform this action. Please request permission or help from your admin if you do not have access to the menu.<br><br>

2. Click on the refresh button for the user with pending upload.
