## How to check if my staff have any pending data?

Check on any pending upload item(s) by each of your user. If you receive a message saying "Unable to Retrieve Results", it could mean the following reason(s):

1. Selected user has an unstable connection and system is unable to connect to their device.
2. Selected user did not have the app running in the background.
3. Selected user had swiped off the app.

i. User has already upload, but admin said did not received it:<br>
