## Start Up Guide

### Get Started with Sales Connection

Whether you're joining an established Workspace or creating one for yourself, set up for success! Sales Connection is flexible and customizable, everyone uses it a little differently.<br>

This article walks you through customizing your experience of Sales Connection.<br>

*Note: Some of the following features have plan-based limits or are optional Sales Connection and must be enabled by an owner or admin.<br><br>


## Create your own Workspace

A Workspace can be used by one or more people.<br>

Whether you're a freelancer, managing a household, or planning a multi-city vacation, a one-person Workspace is useful for your to-do lists, action items, and projects.<br>

If you're solo, you'll be automatically set up with a personal Workspace layout.<br>

If you're creating a new Workspace, get started by learning about our core ClickUp features.<br><br>


## Join a Workspace

Your organization will send you an invite to join their ClickUp Workspace. If you don't have a ClickUp account, you'll be prompted to sign up.<br>

Your organization may require two-factor authentication or use single sign-on (SSO).<br>

If you've joined your organization's Workspace, you can always create your own separate Workspace using the same account, or create a separate ClickUp account with a different email address.<br>


## What's my user type?

- **Admin:** Full access to all system features and settings.
- **Subadmin:** Significant access with some administrative restrictions.
