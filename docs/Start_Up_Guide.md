## Start Up Guide

### Get Started with Sales Connection

Whether you're joining an established Workspace or creating one for yourself, set up for success! Sales Connection is flexible and customizable, everyone uses it a little differently.<br>

This article walks you through customizing your experience of Sales Connection.<br>

*Note: Some of the following features have plan-based limits or are optional Sales Connection and must be enabled by an owner or admin.<br><br>


## Create your own Workspace

A Workspace can be used by one or more people.<br>

Whether you're a freelancer, managing a household, or planning a multi-city vacation, a one-person Workspace is useful for your to-do lists, action items, and projects.<br>

If you're solo, you'll be automatically set up with a personal Workspace layout.<br>

If you're creating a new Workspace, get started by learning about our core ClickUp features.<br><br>


## Join a Workspace

Your organization will send you an invite to join their ClickUp Workspace. If you don't have a ClickUp account, you'll be prompted to sign up.<br>

Your organization may require two-factor authentication or use single sign-on (SSO).<br>

If you've joined your organization's Workspace, you can always create your own separate Workspace using the same account, or create a separate ClickUp account with a different email address.<br>


## What's my user type?

Sales Connection supports various user types, each with distinct levels of access and permissions to ensure proper control and security within the platform:

- **Admin:** Full access to all system features, settings, and user management.
- **Subadmin:** High-level access, with some restrictions compared to Admin.
- **Staff:** Access primarily focused on project management, task execution, and operational activities.

## How is Sales Connection organized?

Sales Connection organizes its data into seven hierarchical levels which is called Data Level Structure, ensuring structured and efficient data management:

- **Customer:** This is the topmost level containing client information, including contact details, addresses, and related interactions.
- **Project:** Projects are organized under customers, representing major initiatives or contracts associated with a customer.
- **Job:** These are specific tasks or activities within a project that need to be completed to fulfill the project's objectives.
- **Digital Form:** Electronic documents used within the system for data collection, processing, and workflow management.
- **Product & Services:** Items and services offered by the company, including details about each product or service.
- **Public Form:** Forms accessible to external users, often used for data collection or public-facing interactions.
- **Asset:** Company resources and equipment, tracked and managed within the system for operational efficiency.
