## I can't load the schedule page. Why?

### Scenarios below will cause this problem and how to solve it:

  1. Bad internet connection.<br>

     a. Is the internet connection & speed strong enough?<br>
        If the internet connection is weak - request the user to connect to another network (e.g. colleagueâ€™s mobile hotspot) and try again.<br>

     b. Is the internet speed fast enough?<br>
        Request the user to download the internet speed testing app:<br>
        Android: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.zwanoo.android.speedtest<br>
        IOS: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/speedtest-by-ookla/id300704847<br>
  
  2. Server error shown.<br>
  
     a. Request information from user<br>
        Account details, consistent error or happen only once, anyone else from the company facing this issue?<br>

     b. If it happens only once, check if its a connection issue.<br>

     c. Check with the developer team.<br>
     
     d. For a response from server error, most likely our side has issues.<br>
