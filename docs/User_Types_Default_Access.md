##  What is user type? 

User type determines the access a user has to the data in the system. For example, an Admin account user has access to all subordinate data (their schedules, jobs, etc), while a Staff account user does not. <br>

There are 5 user types: Main Admin, Admin, Sub Admin, Staff, and Associate User.<br>

## What is the staff category?

Staff category refers to the department/team each staff can be placed in. After placing staff in different categories, you can easily assign tasks to teams, check staff’s schedules based on teams, assign Sub Admin to 
each team, etc. Note that a user can be in more than one Staff Category and a user cannot be without a Staff Category.
<br>

\* To manage staff category (edit/delete): Company Settings > Staff Settings > Department/Team Settings > Staff Category.<br>
\** To edit the category a staff belongs in: User Management > User List. Click the blue pen button beside the relevant user, edit under “Staff Category”, and click “Submit.” <br>
\*** Only the Desktop site and admins can manage staff settings<br>
