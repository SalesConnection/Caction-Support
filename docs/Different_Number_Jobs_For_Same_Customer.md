### Here are the potential issues and solutions:
(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario).<br><br>

1. Filter<br>

   a. Different filters applied will affect the result. Make sure the same filter is applied or click "Clear All" to clear the filters.<br>

2. User Type<br>
  
   a. Different user types will affect job visibility. <br>

      | User Type | Description |
      |-----------|-------------|
      | Admin |  |
      | Sub admin |  |
      | Staff |  |
      | Associate User |  |
     
3. Assign Access<br>

   a. If the user type is the same, assign access might be the cause of job visibility. Only the assigned jobs will be shown.<br>

   b. Make sure the user has been assigned to the job.<br>

4. View Access<br>

   a. If the user type is the same and the job is not assigned to the user, view access might be the cause of the job visibility.<br>

   b. Make sure the user is given the view access in the job.<br>
