## Why is the Console Tab showing a different number of jobs for the same customer?

### Here are the potential issues and solutions:
(If yes to each, move on to the next scenario).<br><br>

**1. Filter**<br>

a. Different filters applied will affect the result. Make sure the same filter is applied or click "Clear All" to clear the filters.<br>

**2. User Type**<br>
  
a. Different user types will affect job visibility. Contact your admin for user access.<br>

   | User Type | Description |
   |-----------|-------------|
   | Admin | Can access everything in the system. |
   | Sub-Admin | Can see all Jobs within the department. |
   | Staff/Associate User | Can only see their own Jobs. |
   
   *Note: These are based on Default Access. Your account may have specific settings. Please check with your Admin if your settings are different from the Default.<br>

**3. Assign Access**<br>

   a. If the user type is the same, assign access might be the cause of job visibility. Only the assigned jobs will be shown.<br>

   b. Make sure the user has been assigned to the job.<br><br>

**4. View Access**<br>

   a. If the user type is the same and the job is not assigned to the user, view access might be the cause of the job visibility.<br>

   b. Make sure the user is given the view access to the job.
