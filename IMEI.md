## üîë IMEI

**What is IMEI?**

IMEI stands for International Mobile Equipment Identity. It is used to track the phone's ID so the user may not be able to log in using other devices.

**Scenarios below will need IMEI:**

1. Unable to log in to the "Sales Connection" app due to a device change?
2. Unable to log in and prompted for IMEI login. (As shown in the picture below)

If you face any of these problems, please find your admin to assist you with disabling the IMEI.

**Where is IMEI and How to Enable It?**

1. To enable the IMEI, go to the desktop site‚Äôs navigation bar > User Management > User List.
